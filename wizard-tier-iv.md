***Sculpt Spells.*** The Wizard's spells don't harm its allies.
 ## Actions

 ***Power Word: Kill (1/day, 9th level spell).*** 60 ft range, 1 target. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. 

 ***Sunburst (1/day, 8th level spell).*** 150 ft range, 60 ft radius sphere, DC 19 CON save. On a failed save, the target takes 47 (12d6+5) radiant damage and is blinded for a minute, or half damage on a success. A blinded target makes a DC 19 CON save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

 ***Teleport (1/day, 7th level spell).*** 10 ft range, the Bard and up to 8 willing creatures within range teleport to anywhere on the same plane of existence.


 ***Disintegrate (1/day, 6th level spell).*** 60 ft range, 1 target, DC 19 DEX save. On a failed save, the target takes 80 (10d6+45) force damage, or half damage on a success. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 HP, they are disintigrated.

 ***Bigby's Hand (1/day, 5th level spell, concentration).*** Melee Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d8) force damage. The Wizard may repeat this attack as a bonus action on each subsequent turn for the next minute.
