 ***War Caster.*** The Druid has advantage on saves to maintain concentration.

***Foresight.*** The Druid has advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. Attack rolls targeting it have disadvantage.
 ## Actions
***Multiattack. (Earth Elemental form only)*** The Druid makes two slam attacks.
 
***Slam. (Earth Elemental form only)*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

 ***Sunburst (1/day), 8th level spell.)*** 150 ft range, 60 ft radius. DC 19 CON save. 12d6 radiant damage and blinded for 1 minuten on a failure. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t blinded by this spell. Blinded creatures repeat the save at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success.

 ***Plane Shift (1/day, 7th level spell.)*** 10 ft range, 9 targets. The cleric and 8 allies in range teleport to a different plane.

 ***Primordial Ward (1/day, 6th level spell, concentration).*** The druid has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage for the next minute, or until it loses concentration. When it takes damage of one of those types, it can use its reaction to gain immunity to that type of damage, including against the triggering damage, after which the spell ends.

 ***Wall of Stone (1/day, 5th level spell, concentration).*** 120 ft range. The druid summons a wall 6 inches thick and composed of ten 10-foot- by-10-foot panels.



 ## Bonus Actions
 ***Earth Elemental Form (1/day).*** The druid gains 126 temp HP. As long as it has this temp HP, it is an earth elemental, it can't cast spells, it has a 30 ft burrow speed, and its AC is 17.```
