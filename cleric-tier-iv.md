 ***War Caster.*** The Cleric has advantage on saves to maintain concentration.

 ***Multiattack (5/day).*** The Cleric makes two Maul attacks, one of which it may replace with a spell.

 ***Maul, +1.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, one target. Hit: 20 (2d6+2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

 ***Mass Heal (1/day, 9th level spell.)*** 60 ft range. Restore 700 HP split between any number of targets in range.

 ***Holy Aura (1/day, 8th level spell, concentration.)*** Range self, 30 foot radius. Friendly creatures have advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell ends.

 ***Plane Shift (1/day, 7th level spell.)*** 10 ft range, 9 targets. The cleric and 8 allies in range teleport to a different plane.


 ***Spirit Guardians (1/day, 5th level spell, concentration.)*** Range self, 15 ft radius, affects creatures of the Cleric's choice. An affected creatureâ€™s speed is halved in the area, DC 17 WIS save when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. 5d8 radiant damage on a failure, 1/2 damage on success.

 ## Reactions
 ***Guided Strike (2/day).*** When the cleric misses an attack, it may choose to add 10 to the attack roll.
