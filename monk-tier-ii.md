***Stunning Strike (2/day).*** When the monk hits a creature with a melee attack, it can force the creature to make a DC14 CON save or be stunned until the end of the Monk's next turn.

 ## Actions
 ***Multiattack.*** The Monk attacks twice with its Quarterstaff, and once with its unarmed attack.

 ***Flurry of Blows (3/day).*** The Monk attacks twice with its Quarterstaff, twice with its Unarmed Attack, and once with either its Shove or its Trip.

 ***Quarterstaff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

 ***Unarmed Attack.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

 ***Shove.*** Target creature must make a DC 14 Strength save or be pushed back 15 feet.

 ***Trip.*** Target creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity save or be knocked prone.
 ## Reactions
***Deflect Missiles.*** When the monk is hit with a ranged weapon attack, it may use its reaction to subtract 15 from the damage. If this reduces the damage to 0, it may make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the ammunition it just caught as part of the same reaction. This attack has +7 to hit and deals 1d6+4 piercing damage.```
