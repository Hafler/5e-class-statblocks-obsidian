 ## Actions
 ***Multiattack.*** The Warlock attacks once with its Repelling Blast and three times with its Eldritch Blast

 ***Repelling Blast.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +11 to hit, reach 120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d10 + 5) force damage and the target is pushed back 10 feet.

 ***Eldritch Blast.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +11 to hit, reach 120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d10 + 5) force damage.

 ***Pyschic Scream (1/day, 9th level spell).*** 60 ft range, 10 targets, DC 19 INT save. On a failed save, a target takes 49 (14d6) psychic damage and is stunned. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t stunned. A stunned target makes a DC 19 INT save at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.

 ***Power Word: Stun (1/day, 8th level spell).*** 60 ft range, 1 target. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

 ***Finger of Death (1/day, 7th level spell).*** 60 ft range, 1 target. DC 19 CON save. 62 (7d8+30) necrotic damage on a failure, or 1/2 damage on a success.

 ***Mental Prison (1/day, 6th level spell, concentration).*** 60 ft range, 1 target, DC 19 INT save. On a success, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage. On a failure, the target takes 28 (5d10) psychic damage, and perceives itself surrounded by fire. The target canâ€™t see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spellâ€™s duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage, and the spell ends.


 ***Dimension Door (2/day, 5th level spell).*** The Warlock and one willing creature within 5 feet teleport up to 500 ft.```
