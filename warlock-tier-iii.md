 ## Actions
 ***Multiattack.*** The Warlock attacks once with its Repelling Blast and twice with its Eldritch Blast

 ***Repelling Blast.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d10 + 5) force damage and the target is pushed back 10 feet.

 ***Eldritch Blast.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d10 + 5) force damage.

 ***Mental Prison (1/day, 6th level spell, concentration).*** 60 ft range, 1 target, DC 17 INT save. On a success, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage. On a failure, the target takes 28 (5d10) psychic damage, and perceives itself surrounded by fire. The target canâ€™t see or hear anything beyond it and is restrained for the spellâ€™s duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage, and the spell ends.

 ***Synaptic Static (1/day, 5th level spell).*** 120 ft range, 20 ft radius sphere, DC 17 INT save. On a failed save, the target takes 28 (8d6) psychic damage, or half damage on a success. Also on a failed save, the target subtracts a d6 from all their attack rolls and concentration checks. A target makes a DC 17 INT save at the end of their turn to end this effect.

 ***Dimension Door (1/day, 5th level spell).*** The Warlock and one willing creature within 5 feet teleport up to 500 ft.```
