***Sculpt Spells.*** The Wizard's spells don't harm its allies.

 ## Actions
 ***Ray of Frost.*** 60 ft range, 1 target, DC 13 CON save. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 cold damage and has disadvantage on its next attack roll.

 ***Shatter (1/day, 2nd level spell).*** 60 ft range, 10 ft radius sphere, DC 13 CON save. On a failed save, an affected creature takes 3d8 thunder damage, or 1/2 damage on a success.

 ***Sleep (1/day, 1st level spell).*** Roll 5d8, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points. Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creatureâ€™s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. 

## Bonus Actions
 ***Misty Step (1/day, 2nd level spell).*** The Wizard teleports 30 feet to a location it can see.

## Reactions

 ***Shield (2/day, 1st level spell).*** As a reaction to being targeted with an attack, the Sorcerer may add 5 to its AC until the beginning of its next turn.```
