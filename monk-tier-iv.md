 ___
***Stunning Strike (7/day).*** When the monk hits a creature with a melee attack, it can force the creature to make a DC19 CON save or be stunned until the end of the Monk's next turn.


***Evasion.*** When the monk makes a Dexterity saving throw, it takes no damage on a success, and half damage if it fails.
 ## Actions
 ***Multiattack.*** The Monk attack four times with its Unarmed Attack, and once with either its Shove or its Trip. It may replace two of its Unarmed Attacks with a single Dodge, Dash, or Disengage action.

 ***Unarmed Attack.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit. Hit: 11 (1d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

 ***Shove.*** Target creature must make a DC 19 Strength save or be pushed back 15 feet.

 ***Trip.*** Target creature must make a DC 19 Dexterity save or be knocked prone.

***Stillness of Mind.*** The Monk ends one effect on itself causing it to be charmed or frightened.

***Quivering Palm (1/day).*** A creature that the Monk has hit with an unarmed attack before must make a DC 19 saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage. Once a creature makes this saving throw, it is immune to this ability until the monk hits it again.

 ## Reactions
***Deflect Missiles.*** When the monk is hit with a ranged weapon attack, it may use its reaction to subtract 23 (1d10+17) from the damage. If this reduces the damage to 0, it may make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the ammunition it just caught as part of the same reaction. This attack has +9 to hit and deals 1d8+5 piercing damage.```
